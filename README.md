Hydroponic Fodder Controller 6.1.1.10

Open source hydroponic fodder watering control system

For those interested in a DYI system to control irrigation in a fodder system, this is a free open source project that uses a micro processor and a relay board. This is posted as an example only and is intended to help growers reduce the cost for a greenhouse control system. No warranty, support, or guarantees are given. The content herein is open source and you are free to use it to build a system - but again this is a do it yourself project.
